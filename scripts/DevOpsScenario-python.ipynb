    "This Python function `count_unique_ips` reads a log file and counts the number of unique IP addresses found in it. Here's a step-by-step explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Function Definition**: \n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def count_unique_ips(log_file_path):\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   The function `count_unique_ips` takes one argument, `log_file_path`, which is the path to the log file.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Initialize a Set**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   unique_ips = set()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   A set named `unique_ips` is initialized to store unique IP addresses. Sets automatically handle duplicates, so each IP address will only be stored once.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Open the Log File**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   with open(log_file_path, 'r') as file:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   The log file is opened in read mode (`'r'`). The `with` statement ensures that the file is properly closed after its suite finishes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Read Each Line**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   for line in file:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   The function iterates over each line in the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Extract the IP Address**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   ip = line.split()[0]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Each line is split into a list of words using the `split()` method (which splits by whitespace by default). The first element of this list (index `0`) is assumed to be the IP address.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Add IP to Set**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   unique_ips.add(ip)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   The extracted IP address is added to the `unique_ips` set.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Return the Count of Unique IPs**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   return len(unique_ips)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   The function returns the number of unique IP addresses by getting the length of the `unique_ips` set.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Example Usage**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   log_file_path = 'access.log'\n",
    "   print(count_unique_ips(log_file_path))\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   An example usage of the function is provided. It sets the `log_file_path` to `'access.log'` and prints the result of `count_unique_ips(log_file_path)`.\n",

    "   ```python\n",
    "   usage_percentage = (used / total) * 100\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   The percentage of disk space used is calculated by dividing the used space by the total space and then multiplying by 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Check Against Threshold**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   if usage_percentage > threshold:\n",
    "       print(\"Alert: Disk usage is above threshold!\")\n",
    "   else:\n",
    "       print(\"Disk usage is within safe limits.\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   The function checks if the calculated usage percentage is greater than the specified threshold. If it is, it prints an alert message. Otherwise, it prints a message indicating that the disk usage is within safe limits.\n",

    "6. **Example Usage**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   check_disk_usage(80)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   An example usage of the function is provided. It calls `check_disk_usage` with a threshold of 80%, meaning it will print an alert if the disk usage exceeds 80%.\n",
    "\n",
    "This function is useful for monitoring disk usage and ensuring that it does not exceed a specified limit, which can help prevent disk space issues."

    "This code retrieves the compliance status of AWS Config rules using the `boto3` library to interact with the AWS Config service. The function `check_config_compliance` calls the `get_compliance_summary_by_config_rule` method to get a summary of compliance for all Config rules. It then iterates over the summary and prints the name and compliance status of each rule. This can be useful for monitoring the compliance of resources in your AWS environment according to the rules defined in AWS Config."

    "This Python code snippet is designed to be used as an AWS Lambda function that responds to CloudWatch alarm events. When a CloudWatch alarm transitions to the \"ALARM\" state, the function stops a specified EC2 instance. Here's a step-by-step explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Import the `boto3` Library**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import boto3\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   The `boto3` library is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) SDK for Python, which allows Python developers to write software that makes use of services like Amazon EC2 and CloudWatch.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Lambda Handler Function**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def lambda_handler(event, context):\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   The `lambda_handler` function is the entry point for AWS Lambda. It takes two arguments:\n",
    "   - `event`: The event data that triggered the Lambda function (in this case, a CloudWatch alarm event).\n",
    "   - `context`: The runtime information of the Lambda function.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Extract Alarm Name and State**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   alarm_name = event['detail']['alarmName']\n",
    "   state = event['detail']['state']['value']\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - `alarm_name`: Extracts the name of the CloudWatch alarm from the event data.\n",
    "   - `state`: Extracts the state of the CloudWatch alarm from the event data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Check Alarm State**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   if state == 'ALARM':\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Checks if the state of the CloudWatch alarm is \"ALARM\".\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Stop EC2 Instance**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')\n",
    "   ec2.stop_instances(InstanceIds=['i-1234567890abcdef0'])\n",
    "   print(f\"Alarm triggered: {alarm_name}. EC2 instance stopped.\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **Create EC2 Client**:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     Creates a client for the EC2 service using `boto3`.\n",
    "   - **Stop Instances**:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     ec2.stop_instances(InstanceIds=['i-1234567890abcdef0'])\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     Calls the `stop_instances` method on the EC2 client to stop the specified EC2 instance. Replace `'i-1234567890abcdef0'` with the actual instance ID you want to stop.\n",
    "   - **Print Message**:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     print(f\"Alarm triggered: {alarm_name}. EC2 instance stopped.\")\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     Prints a message indicating that the alarm was triggered and the EC2 instance was stopped.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Example Usage**:\n",

    "This code is designed to be used as an AWS Lambda function that responds to CloudWatch alarm events. When a CloudWatch alarm transitions to the \"ALARM\" state, the function stops a specified EC2 instance. The function extracts the alarm name and state from the event data, checks if the state is \"ALARM\", and then stops the EC2 instance using the `boto3` library.

    "To ensure that the AWS Lambda function captures both the `event` and `context` from CloudWatch, you need to deploy the function correctly and configure the CloudWatch alarm to trigger the Lambda function. The `event` parameter will contain the details of the CloudWatch alarm event, and the `context` parameter will provide runtime information about the Lambda function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a step-by-step guide to achieve this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define the Lambda Function**:\n",
    "   Ensure your Lambda function is defined to accept both `event` and `context` parameters. The function provided already does this correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import boto3\n",
    "\n",
    "   def lambda_handler(event, context):\n",

    "           print(f\"Alarm triggered: {alarm_name}. EC2 instance stopped.\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Deploy the Lambda Function**:\n",
    "   Deploy the Lambda function using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or an Infrastructure as Code tool like AWS CloudFormation or Terraform.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Create a CloudWatch Alarm**:\n",
    "   Create a CloudWatch alarm that monitors a specific metric and configure it to trigger the Lambda function when the alarm state changes to \"ALARM\".\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Configure CloudWatch to Trigger Lambda**:\n",
    "   When creating or modifying the CloudWatch alarm, set up an action to trigger the Lambda function. This can be done in the AWS Management Console under the \"Actions\" section of the alarm configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Ensure Correct IAM Permissions**:\n",
    "   Ensure that the Lambda function has the necessary IAM permissions to stop EC2 instances. Attach a policy to the Lambda execution role that allows the `ec2:StopInstances` action.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example IAM policy:\n",
    "   ```json\n",
    "   {\n",
    "       \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n",
    "       \"Statement\": [\n",
    "           {\n",
    "               \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n",
    "               \"Action\": \"ec2:StopInstances\",\n",
    "               \"Resource\": \"*\"\n",
    "           }\n",
    "       ]\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Test the Setup**:\n",
    "   After deploying the Lambda function and configuring the CloudWatch alarm, test the setup by triggering the alarm condition. Verify that the Lambda function is invoked and that it stops the specified EC2 instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example CloudWatch Alarm Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of how you might configure a CloudWatch alarm to trigger the Lambda function:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create or Modify a CloudWatch Alarm**:\n",
    "   - Go to the CloudWatch console.\n",
    "   - Select \"Alarms\" from the navigation pane.\n",
    "   - Click \"Create Alarm\" or select an existing alarm to modify.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Specify Metric and Conditions**:\n",
    "   - Choose the metric you want to monitor.\n",
    "   - Set the conditions for the alarm (e.g., threshold, period).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Configure Actions**:\n",
    "   - In the \"Actions\" section, click \"Add action\".\n",
    "   - Select \"Send to an Amazon SNS topic\" or \"Send to an AWS Lambda function\".\n",
    "   - Choose the Lambda function you deployed.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Review and Create**:\n",
    "   - Review the alarm configuration.\n",
    "   - Click \"Create alarm\" to save the changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these steps, your Lambda function will be correctly set up to capture both the `event` and `context` from CloudWatch when the alarm triggers. The `event` parameter will contain the details of the CloudWatch alarm event, allowing your function to respond appropriately."
